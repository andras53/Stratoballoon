# Stratoballoon
**Codebase for high-altitude balloon simulation**

The Club of Young Physicists from Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsv√°ri Fizikus Klub - KFK) within the framework of it's latest project set the goal of launching a high-altitude balloon into the Stratosphere. The aim of the high-altitude balloon is to deliver a measuring equipment to the Stratosphere (approximately 20 km above sea level), which contains a set of different sensors to collect atmospheric data.  

This repository holds our code used to [simulate vertical and horizontal displacements](simulation/balloon_trajectory.py) of the balloon based on [simple models](theoretical_background.md) and weather forecast data from [ECMFW](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data).
